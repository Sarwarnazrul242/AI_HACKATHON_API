# MiDOK---Health-App

#Description 
I'm really into bringing together technology and healthcare, and I was part of a great team that built the MiDOK project. Together, we made this tool to help doctors and nurses quickly figure out health problems. We created both Android and iOS versions of the app, and my special focus was on the Android side.

In our project, my role was to make the part of the app where AI gives smart suggestions to help narrow down health issues. I worked to make sure this feature was easy to use on Android devices. I'm proud of how we made our tool helpful for everyone in healthcare, whether they're already working in the field or still learning.

Using technology to improve healthcare is something I'm passionate about. My aim is to contribute to a system where patients get the care they need quickly and accurately, and I'm excited about the difference our app can make.
